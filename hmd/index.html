    <p><b>A</b>t long last, I can f<b>i</b>nally say these words I always wish to say to you: "Happy Mother's day my dear wife!"</p>
    <p>You ne<b>v</b>er ceased to inspire me ever<b>y</b> single day to be the best version of myse<b>l</b>f.</p>

    <h3 class="mt60">As a wife:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Through ups and d<b>o</b>wns, witnessing shifts of favor with you is nothing but a charm!</li>
      <li>Through ups, there's <b>n</b>othing more I wish for than sharin<b>g</b> it with you.</li>
      <li>Through the downs, you are so tactical - one of <b>t</b>he most calm person I knew, planning instead <b>o</b>f complaining nor panic - What <b>A</b> Woman!</li>
      <li>Throughout those spins, I have grown my <b>l</b>ove for you even more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt60">Motherhood:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>From Bags and Shoes to Cetaphil and Cradle.</li>
      <li>From H&amp;M, Uniqlo, Terranova to Baby Company.</li>
      <li>From personal care to baby care.</li>
      <li>From movie nights to <b>d</b>ancing-the-baby to sleep nights.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt60">Oh! How amazing how you quickly and op<b>e</b>nly adapt to those changes. You think I didn't acknowledge those eh? Thank you for that Mama!</p>

    <p class="mt60">I am so proud of the Woman and a Mother you've become. I love you and always will.</p>

    <p class="mt60">Happy Moth<b>e</b>r's day, my Aivy!</p>

    <p class="mt60">Always,</p>
    <p>Andrian</p>
