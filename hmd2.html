    <p class="mt60">Thank you for all you have done to me. You always try to lead me to comfort even if it costs yours, satisfies my need and unconditionally love me.</p>

    <p class="mt60">If you ever needed someone to talk to, a shoulder to cry on, a hand to help you through your rainy days, I promise to always be here with you until we reach the boundary of time and space.</p>
    <p>If you're feeling weak, I will try to give you all the strength you need.</p>
    
    <p class="mt60">There's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you, 'cause I love you, and that is all that matters!</p>

    <p class="mt60">For the moment, please be patient with me as I am still trying to understand how life really works and how can I fit in.</p>
    
    <p class="mt60">Because of you, I am here. Thank you!</p>
    <p class="mt60">Happy Mother's Day Mama!</p>

    <p class="mt60">Love,</p>
